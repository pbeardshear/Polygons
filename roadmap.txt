// Planned next steps
1. Layered Rendering
	- Provide support for drawing on distinct canvas layer, or drawing off grid (i.e. not confined to stay on edges)
	- Support for stroked paths (lists of sequenced corners) for rivers and roads
2. Rivers module
	- noisy deflections from baseline, think of data structure to efficiently represent this
	- deflections must be contained with polygon formed by centers and corners of adjacent polygons
3. 3D Viewer
	- Implement WebGL 3D representation of map, with elevation and slope taken into account
	- Rotations, zooming, panning should be supported, support for time of day and seasons may come later
4. Algorithm for generating land/ocean demarcation
	- Inkblot method: generate random locations on map, then expand around those polygons to generate spreading "inkblots"
	- Introduce noise at edges, and add random locations for lakes (water surrounded by land)
5. Biome/Weather
	- Add support for classifying regions based on elevation and moisture, then fit these properties into a 
	  table of biome types.
	- Additionally, add weather types to each biome based on season
6. Roads
	- Constructed paths that are not required to always run along a defined polygon edge, to achieve a more natural
	  curvature
